# rock-paper-scissors

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game I built with my own, original JavaScript code. 

To play, you make your selection of rock, paper, or scissors, and then the computer makes its own random selection. The game will then tell you who won the round and the score. 

The overrall winner is decided after 5 rounds.

Right now, you can only play the game from the console, but I will eventually make a user interface for the game.
