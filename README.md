# rock-paper-scissors

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game I built with my own, original JavaScript code. 

To play, you make your selection of rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer makes its own random selection. The game will then tell you who won the round and the current score. 

First to 5 points wins the overall game.
